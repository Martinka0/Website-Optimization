 **Website optimization:**
* Made a "dist" file with production ready files.
* In-lined style.css into index.html.
* In-lined web font into index.html.
* Compressed  and resized all images
* Minified HTML, CSS and JaveScript files.
* Set print.css to media="print"
* Add async for links to JaveScript files and move them to the end of the body in the index.html.
* Added a meta tag for Cache-control.
* Changed logic in the main.js to stop force synchronous layout and improve performance.
  (Please see comments in the main.js file)
* Used Gulp for automatization (compression and minifications of some files)
